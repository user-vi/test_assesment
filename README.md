# Monetization analysis & Pricing experiments
1. How can we improve subscriber retention? Propose 3 ideas per both product improvements and enhancing monetization techniques.

We improve subscriber retention to improving an engagement, happyness, motivation. It was sorted by my priority:
- Family subscribtion (as youtube). I guess, if family has an musition instrument, other family members could be interested in it. (monetization)
- Defferent durations of subscribtion: 1 weeks, 3 months, 6 month. (monetization, cannibalization problem)
- Decrease marketing costs. Experiments with different channels and attribution models. (monetization)
- Advertising in trial period. Possible advertising might pay for no subscription. (monetization)
- Market research. Ð¡ompetitive market analysis and provide the same new features. (subscriber retention)
- Motivation. Motivation is the most importance part of education. For example, set up student's goals and remind about it. (subscriber retention)
- AI teacher. Propose personal recommendation using AI and student's progress. AI algorithm analyses behavior, preferences, and engagement patterns. AI helps to student to get positive changes faster and offer more relevant lessons. Promote this feature for marketing strategies as AI innovation. (subscriber retention)


2. How can LTV be used to inform monetization strategies and experiments?

- ML Modeling. Develop predictive models that estimate LTV for new users early in their behavior. This information can help change marketing strategies towards users with higher potential value.

- Retention strategies. Improving user retention directly impacts LTV. Identification reason that contribute to user churn and implement strategies to improve retention. It could be experiments with push notifications.

- Pricing strategies. Experiment with different pricing models and monitor how they affect LTV. Searching pricing strategies to find the right balance on demand curve.

- Segmentation using LTV cohorts. Analyze LTV across different acquisition channels, demographics, geographies, or other  segments.

- A/B Testing. Implement A/B testing for different monetization strategies or user's experience. Use convertions as a primary metric and LTV as a second mertic to evaluate the success of A/B tests.

- Continuously monitor LTV trends and performance.

3. How price optimization might help to improve monetization efficiency?

- Profit maximization. Pricing directly affects a company's profit. Price optimization helps to balance between profit and demand.
- Competitiveness. Correct pricing provide a company to be competitive in the global market. Comparing prices with competitors and adapting to changes in the industry allows to attract customers.
- Adapting changed cost. Price optimization enables companies to respond effectively to changes in production costs and other operating costs.


4. How would you decide where to differentiate the prices and how would you arrange the pricing experiment? What metrics would you use, how would you evaluate the results?

Differentiate the prices usualy depence on country, device type. The main mertics is conversion rate (purchase). Also I would look at LTV, revenue, marketing cost. AB tests have to have on randomised sample with fixed metric and stat test before start. AS-test evaluate on statistical test (for example T-test). Also if we can use different methods to descrease a variance.

It depends on a monatization strategy in company. It could be:
- a price lower then competitive price
- recommended price by expert
- +10%/-10% from based price
- temporary discount
- min/max limits

I can image two different type of experiments, it depends on monetization techniques:
- AB-test with target measere is convertions. Analyst fixes new price (for example, discount -10% * based_price), statistical test, metrics, sample size, and target segment before experiment and runs experiment. After experiment evaluate result about new price.
- Force elasticity. Analyst provide different prices candidates on target segment and evaluate price elasticity, demand, and margin.
